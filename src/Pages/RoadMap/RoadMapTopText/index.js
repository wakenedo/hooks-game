                OK now allow me to not be all serious, fo r this one at least. Because indeed if we reached the last milestone of this project it means we went there, we climbed the mountain. Guys , we did it, step my step and conquered it, and we even had some chuckles and giggles along they way, which is great of course. And also we had made this experience possible, a community driven game, free to play, pay to support. A satire game. A satire game of gaming, for gamers. Yea it's crazy I know, now that I wrote it down, it definitely sounds like crazy stuff, but I thought that it could work out. We are sure about to figure out, no matter the results if is a meteor rise or a limbo thing it sure was an amazing experience and I appreciate you, no mather where we go from here I thank you for being here. Never forget, break some sweat Drop The Ball.
