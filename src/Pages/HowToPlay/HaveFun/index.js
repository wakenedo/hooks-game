               Even if you can never achieve the prized top of the leader boards, the real goal of all of this is to have some fun, for a brief moment, or a long period of hours. Its not a competitive game by design, so just click the buttons gently and enjoy the music if you’re that type of player, or you can be that player that throws its mouse at the wall because he lost a challenge It’s all ok, no one is good at everything. For the firs player, give him some energetics, and for the second, take a deep breath and chill out man. Ok jokes aside, Ok i know they were not that funny. Ok I know maybe they were not funny at all. And that’s the point? Find fun in boring things? Hell no Drop the Ball is a hell of a fun game. Ok, maybe exaggerating things a bit. But no mather what, have fun and enjoy a little bit of a good old Drop The Ball break the sweat making combo after combo or just passively clicking the buttons while you sip your coffee mug or tea. Tea is decent, no offense tea guys.
