               This is the building phase, which consists in building upon the foundation developed in Phase 1, Beta 1 will be exciting, the addition of Leader Boards will entice the community, the addition of Player-versus-player with matching skirmishes, points battle, follow the master and Achievements which will be a great part of the experience. Beta 2 will be interesting with the addition of the in-game shop for points and currency mainly as another way to support the project, there the player will find balls, backgrounds, and other customizables for the User Area. Improved User Area, with a PvP tab, Balls Owned and Regular Mode Challenges. Beta 3 is going to be the last building block with a new mode reveal, an event awarding balls and skins the PvP season(beta), the addition of two new features to the game, which are combo streaks to make things more interesting to hardcore players competing for the charts, will basically be a combo of combos to multiply your points to the maximum, and Regular Mode Events that will be monthly and will add rules and challenges to the Regular Mode and will reward balls, skins and currency to players. This features will be the core of the game once they're implemented and working as intended the game will be launched officially but there are still some more steps to take.
